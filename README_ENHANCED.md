# 🥽 Pulto3: VisionOS Spatial Data Visualization System

A cutting-edge spatial computing platform that transforms Jupyter notebooks into immersive 3D visualizations in VisionOS. Built with SwiftUI, RealityKit, and FastAPI, Pulto3 enables data scientists and researchers to interact with their data in three-dimensional space.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Pulto3 bridges the gap between traditional data science workflows and spatial computing by:

- **Importing Jupyter notebooks** and automatically extracting visualizations, DataFrames, and code
- **Creating spatial windows** in VisionOS for different data types (charts, 3D models, point clouds)
- **Enabling immersive interaction** with data through gesture controls and spatial manipulation
- **Providing real-time collaboration** through WebSocket connections and shared workspaces
- **Supporting multiple data formats** including CSV, USDZ, PLY, PCD, and custom formats

### 🎨 Key Features

- **🖼️ Multi-Window Spatial Interface**: Create and manage multiple floating windows in 3D space
- **📊 Interactive Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and plots that respond to spatial gestures
- **🔮 3D Model Viewer**: USDZ model loading with interactive manipulation
- **☁️ Point Cloud Visualization**: Support for scientific and LiDAR data visualization
- **📱 Workspace Management**: Save, load, and share complete spatial arrangements
- **🔄 Real-time Sync**: Live updates between VisionOS app and backend services
- **🧮 DataFrame Integration**: Interactive table views with filtering and sorting
- **🎯 Template System**: Pre-built workspace templates for common use cases
