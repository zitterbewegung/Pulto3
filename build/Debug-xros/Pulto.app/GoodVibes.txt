Why does this image give the error I am seeing for visionos in xcode ?
/Users/r2q2/Projects/Pulto3/Pulto/App/Assets.xcassets The last visionOS App Icon Layer with content, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, must be a fully opaque bitmap. The pixel at position (0, 0) has an alpha value of 0.

The error you're seeing:
The last visionOS App Icon Layer with content, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, must be a fully opaque bitmap. The pixel at position (0, 0) has an alpha value of 0.
‚Ä¶is caused because the image you provided has transparent pixels, including at position (0, 0) ‚Äî the very top-left corner. This violates Apple's visionOS icon requirements, which mandate that the background image be fully opaque.
üîß Fix Options:
To fix the error:
Make the entire background fully opaque, including corners.
Ensure there are no alpha/transparency values anywhere in the PNG.
üõ†Ô∏è Solution Options:
‚úÖ Option 1: Flatten onto white
If you want to keep the design exactly as-is but remove transparency:
Open the image in a tool like Preview, Photoshop, or Pixelmator.
Add a solid white (or desired background) layer beneath.
Export as PNG-24 with full opacity.
‚úÖ Option 2: Replace transparent with solid fill via command line
You can use ImageMagick:
convert input.png -background white -alpha remove -alpha off output.png
This will remove all transparency and flatten it onto white.
Once this corrected image is saved and re-added to Assets.xcassets, Xcode will stop throwing the opaque bitmap error for the "Back" layer.
Let me know if you want me to regenerate the background layer with full opacity.
