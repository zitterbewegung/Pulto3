#  Creating a volumetric window in visionOS

This sample demonstrates how to create and display 3D models with SwiftUI's volumetric window in an
visionOS app.

At launch, the app starts two types of window groups:
- A SwiftUI window that contains text
- A SwiftUI volumetric window that contains a 3D model

For more information about the app and how it works, see [Creating a volumetric window in visionOS][link-to-sample] in the developer documentation.
