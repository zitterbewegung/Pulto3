#  Creating a volumetric window in visionOS

This app brings the power of Jupyter notebooks to spatial computing, enabling developers, researchers, and designers to prototype and execute immersive 3D and XR applications with live code, visualization, and interaction. Users can write Python code to control spatial scenes, integrate real-time sensor data, visualize 3D models, and manipulate environments directly within a notebook interface. The app supports spatial data libraries, RealityKit and WebXR integration, and live previews of AR/VR content. With modular kernels and a collaborative interface, it transforms spatial computing workflows into an interactive, scriptable, and reproducible development experience, bridging the gap between code and immersive spatial environments.

This sample demonstrates how to create and display 3D models with SwiftUI's volumetric window in a
visionOS app. The app launches directly into a volumetric window containing a 3D model.

For more information about the app and how it works, see [Creating a volumetric window in visionOS][link-to-sample] in the developer documentation.
