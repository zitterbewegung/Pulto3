#  Creating a volumetric window in visionOS

This sample demonstrates how to create and display 3D models with SwiftUI's volumetric window in a
visionOS app. The app launches directly into a volumetric window containing a 3D model.

For more information about the app and how it works, see [Creating a volumetric window in visionOS][link-to-sample] in the developer documentation.
